# How to play
Ludorus is currently under development and can not be played. Sorry.

Welcome to the town of Ludorus (loo-do-rus)! You have just moved in to your new cabin, and as a sort of housewarming gift, the city council has given you **100** coins. To check your balance, use the `?balance` command in chat. The chat is how you do everything in Ludorus and this guide exsists to give you a helping hand with the many commands used to interact with the game.

You don't get to rest quite yet though. Your coins won't last you long
