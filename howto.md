# How to play
Ludorus is currently under development and can not be played. Sorry.

Welcome to the town of Ludorus! You have just moved in to your new cabin, and as a sort of housewarming gift, the city council has given you **100** coins. To check your balance, use the `?balance` command in chat. The chat is how you do everything in Ludorus and this guide exsists to give you a helping hand with the many commands used to interact with the game.
